SDKK.IDE Development Notes
1. Project Purpose
SDKK.IDE is a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for programmers.

Core focus: Code editing with Syntax Highlighting and Dependency Management.

Long-term goal: Evolve into an extensible IDE with plugins and advanced debugging tools.

2. Current Features
✅ Syntax Highlighting

Supports common languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

Extensible for additional languages.

✅ Dependency Deployment

Automated library management (e.g., via npm or pip).

⚠️ Needs Improvement

Advanced Debugging (Breakpoints, Step Debugging).

Auto-Fix for Errors (e.g., Quick Fix like VS Code).

3. How to Contribute
A) For Developers
markdown
1. **Report Bugs**:  
   - Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Fbmi86/Doors_SDKK_IDE/issues) with details.  
   - Example:  
     ```plaintext
     Title: Crash when opening large files  
     Steps to reproduce:  
     1. Open any file >1MB.  
     2. IDE freezes.  
     ```

2. **Submit Pull Requests**:  
   - Fork → Make changes → Test → Open a PR.  
B) For Non-Developers
Testing & Feedback: Report UI/UX issues.

Documentation: Translate docs to other languages.

4. Suggested Architecture

Code

1. Core Modules
SDKK.IDE Core:

Central controller for the IDE.

Handles UI rendering, plugin management, and communication between modules.

2. Syntax Highlighter
Input: Raw source code.

Output: Color-formatted code (e.g., keywords, strings in different colors).

Dependencies: Language definition files (e.g., .json or .tmLanguage).

3. Dependency Manager
Function:

Installs libraries (e.g., npm install or pip install).

Validates dependencies from config files (package.json, requirements.txt).

Tools: Integrates with package managers (npm, pip, etc.).

4. Debugger Adapter
Components:

Breakpoint Manager: Sets/stops breakpoints in code.

Step Execution: Supports step-in, step-over, step-out.

Variable Inspector: Live view of variables during debugging.

Protocol: Can use Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for IDE-agnostic support.

5. Plugin System (Future)
Extension Points:

Syntax highlighters for new languages.

Debugger adapters for custom runtimes.

API: Exposes hooks for third-party plugins.

Data Flow Example
User opens a file → Core loads it.

Syntax Highlighter processes the file → Colors sent to UI.

User clicks "Debug" → Debugger Adapter starts a session.

Breakpoint hit → Variable Inspector updates live values.

Key Dependencies
Module	Tools/Libraries
Syntax Highlighter	Tree-sitter, Ace Editor
Dependency Manager	npm, pip, yarn
Debugger Adapter	DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol)
Plugin System	IPC (Inter-Process Comm)




5. Development Roadmap
Add Basic Debugger (e.g., using pdb or node-inspect).

Integrate Linters (ESLint/Pylint) for error detection.

Plugin Support (like VS Code Extensions).

6. Technical Notes
Testing: Use unittest/pytest for new code.

Docs: Update README.md for new features.
